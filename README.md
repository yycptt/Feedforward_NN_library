# Feedforward_NN_library
A simple library for feed-forward neural network as an exercise for the Coursera Deep Learning course.

Usage example can be found in the example1.py and example2.py

Currently supports:
- Layers
  * Fully Connected
  * Dropout
  * Softmax
  
- Activations
  * Sigmoid
  * Tanh
  * Relu
  * Leaky Relu
  * Linear
  
- Loss Functions
  * Cross Entropy
  * Binary Entropy
  * MSE
  * Softmax + Cross Entropy

- Optimizer
  * Gradient Descent Optimizer
  * Adam Optimizer
  
- Other
  * L2 Regularization
  
Future Work:
  - Add Convolutional Layer
